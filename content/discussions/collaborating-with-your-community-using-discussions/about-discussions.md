Anyone who can has access to a repository can create and participate in discussions once a repository administrator or project maintainer has enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}. Similarly, if an organization owner enables {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for an organization, anyone who can view the source repository can create an organization discussion.
